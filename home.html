                            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>

                            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. </p>

                            <p> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;margin-top:-45px"><strong>Rohit Sharma</strong> (born April 30, 1987, Bansod, India) is an Indian international cricketer and the current captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, One-Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 International (T20I). Sharma also captained the Mumbai Indians, a franchise team in the Indian Premier League (IPL), for 10 years and led them to five titles. Sharma is known for his batting prowess and is nicknamed “Hitman” by his fans. He is also an occasional off-spinner.

                        Sharma is the only player to have scored three double hundreds in ODI cricket; no other player has scored even two. He also holds the record for most international sixes across all formats, most sixes in World Cups, and the highest individual score in an ODI. He was a member of the Indian sides that won the 2007 T20I World Cup and the 2013 ICC (International Cricket Council) Champions Trophy.</p>

                    <p><p style="margin-top:20px;margin-left:750px;width:500px;text-align: justify;">Sharma was born on April 30, 1987, in Bansod, Nagpur, in the state of Maharashtra, India. He first joined a cricket camp in 1999, when coach Dinesh Lad, a friend of his uncle’s, noticed his talent. Lad used to scout for talent in those days and was very impressed with the way Sharma bowled. Knowing that Sharma’s uncle would not be able to afford the fees for the school where Lad was coach, Lad convinced the school’s director to accept Sharma as a student and waive his entire fee so that he would have access to good training facilities. Sharma started off as a spinner before focusing on batting.

                        Sharma made his senior-level debut in a List A game in 2006, scoring an unbeaten 31 for West Zone against Central Zone in the Deodhar Trophy. His run of scores in the tournament got him picked for the India A squad, and he made his first-class debut for India Athat team against New Zealand at Darwin later in 2006, scoring 57 and 22, respectively. India achieved a 3-wicket win over New Zealand. He subsequently made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai, one of the leading (and hard to break into) teams in the Indian domestic circuit, in the 2006–07 season and impressed with a double hundred while playing against Gujarat, as well as a half-century in a winning cause in the final that year. Sharma has gone on to represent Mumbai throughout his first-class career</p></p>
